            <br
            <p>
                The main product, also a bestseller, is the Iced Caramel Macchiato. The owners of Don Macchiatos offered a modest price for their target market and customers because their goal is to provide something affordable for everyone. They wanted to deliver tasty, quality coffee to the Cebuanos without compromising their budget. Miss Nickie recalled that she had to save money to buy coffee by skipping meals as a student. Now, she does not want students or anyone to experience that.
                
                And that is how a 39-peso iced caramel macchiato was born! The owner decides to keep the price at that range so everyone can afford great-tasting coffee anytime!
                
                Cebuanos have this common phrase “Bahala og ginagmay, basta kanunay” This phrase reflects the value of consistency no matter how little the circumstances are, which the secret behind Don Macchiatos’s success is. This affordably best coffee shop in Cebu welcomes franchisees who share the same vision of bringing affordable coffee to anyone who wants it. The owners genuinely believe that all coffee shops in IT Park Cebu and other coffee shops in the city should learn to support one another in giving the Cebuanos the tasty coffee they deserve.
                
                Because of the overwhelming support, this famous yet humble coffee shop also offers its coffee at PhP39 in all branches in Cebu.

                <br>

                Coffee is not a luxury—it is a necessity! Coffee keeps everyone going and helps to energize and refresh you as you take on your daily hustle. Coffee should not always be expensive, thanks to Cebu’s pride—Don Macchiatos!
